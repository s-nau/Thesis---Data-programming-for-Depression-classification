This repository contains the code used for my udnergraduate thesis. We used a weak supervision framework called data programming to label reddit posts by depression status. We then used a Support vector machine for a supervised method. We do not include the data we scraped here, but can provide that upon request. Some of the files are jupyer notebooks while others are .py files.
